### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Creates and deletes a student question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_06-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/manageStudentQuestion.js#L30)
 - [Try to create a student question with wrong input](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_06-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/manageStudentQuestion.js#L36)
 - [Create a student question, teacher evaluates the question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_06-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/manageStudentQuestion.js#L58)
 - [Creates 3 student questions, teacher evaluates 2, student views the evaluations](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_06-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/manageStudentQuestion.js#L73)
 - [Creates a student questions, try to evaluate question with wrong input](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_06-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/manageStudentQuestion.js#L93)


#### Rationale

1. Students will submit and delete questions (basic case).
2. Show invalid cases i.e. students might try to submit a question without enough information.
3. Teachers will evaluate questions submitted by the students (basic case).
4. Students will need to see the feedback on their submitted question. In this test we also test all the possible evaluations.
5. Show invalid cases i.e. teachers might try to reject a submitted question without a proper justification.
