### End-to-end tests

#### Created tests

 - [Create a student question, teacher evaluates the question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_06-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/manageStudentQuestion.js#L58)
 - [Creates 3 student questions, teacher evaluates 2, student views the evaluations](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20al_06-project/blob/develop/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/manageStudentQuestion.js#L73)

#### Rationale

1. Students will submit and delete questions (basic case).
2. Show invalid cases i.e. students might try to submit a question without enough information.
3. Teachers will evaluate questions submitted by the students (basic case).
4. Students will need to see the feedback on their submitted question. In this test we also test all the possible evaluations.
5. Show invalid cases i.e. teachers might try to reject a submitted question without a proper justification.

#### Commands defined

#### Rationale
The test cases we defined represent the most common user use cases asociated with each feature, and also some use cases where the user gives wrong input. These tests are important to verify if the whole feature is working correctly and to check some borderline use cases that could go wrong.
For each feature we defined one test for standard use case and several tests for wrong behaviors performed in the interface.
